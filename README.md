## **ðŸ‘€ Next to work**
Between tennis, mountain biking, athletics and weight training, I've always been into sports. I also enjoy playing football, basketball, and many others from time to time.
I also have been passionate about photography for several years now, capturing everything from landscapes to wildlife, constantly exploring new techniques to improve my skills.
